### How to run
1) pull the repo to a computer. 
 
2) $ sh install.sh

### Test environment
pg Admin 4 was used to test the stream replication

### Extra comments

'postgres:latest' docker image uses postgres 12.
Replication configurations vary between versions,
this solution is only suitable for the latest postgres version,
which is 12.

### Thank you
